HPP-GIK Tutorial
================

This package contains a small tutorial for hpp-gik. It relies on hpp-gik
for motion planning and robot-viewer for visualization. The robot
configurations generated by hpp-gik are sent to the robot-viewer server
through Corba.

Prerequites
-----------

Before installing this package, make sure you have installed:

* [hpp-gik](https://github.com/laas/hpp-gik/)
* [jrl-dynamics](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/jrl-dynamics/)
* [robot-viewer](https://github.com/laas/robot-viewer/)
* omniORB4

Setup
-----

To compile this package, it is recommended to create a separate build
directory:

    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    cmake [OPTIONS] ..
    make install

Running the package
-------------------

Before running the tutorial script, make sure you have a naming service 
running (`omniNames`). Then launch:

	hpp-gik-tutorial

The robot-viewer server outputs some log messages, such as:

    robotviewer.kinematic_server:INFO:parsed_config <robotviewer.kinematic_server.CustomConfigParser instance at 0x93d12cc>
    robotviewer.display_server:INFO:Creating window
    OpenGL.GLUT.special:INFO:Cleaning up context data for window 1: True
    use_shader= True
    robotviewer.kinematic_server:INFO:parsed_config <robotviewer.kinematic_server.CustomConfigParser instance at 0xe3580ec>
    robotviewer.display_server:ERROR:romeo Element with that name exists already
    None

Then the planning is done. hpp-gik also outputs some log messages. It is
normal that during whole-body motion execution, the trajectory of the ZMP
slightly differs from the planned trajectory. You might observe messages
such as:

     Eccentered ZMP: 0.0418092 , 0.0580008 at time 2.305

When the planning is finished, the romeo model will start moving. If you want
to change the stack of tasks solved by the robot, edit the file:

     src/application.cc

The tasks are defined in function `createTask()`. For more 
information on how to create and solve tasks, have a look at 
the `hpp-gik` package documentation.
